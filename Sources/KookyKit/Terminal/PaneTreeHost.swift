/// AppKit workspace-persistence shell — the C2 hybrid boundary.
///
/// **AppKit owns "which workspace is visible"; SwiftUI owns everything inside
/// a workspace.** One `PaneTreeHostView` per window (owned by
/// `KookyWindowController`, mounted through a stable representable) keeps one
/// `WorkspaceRootView` per workspace alive for the workspace's whole lifetime
/// and flips visibility on switches. That alone kills the old
/// `.id(workspace.id)` teardown class (focus races on switch / issue #24,
/// detach-gap scale bugs / issue #8, switch flicker) — while the split tree,
/// pane chrome, zoom and divider animations inside each container stay the
/// battle-tested SwiftUI implementation with its own coordinated layout
/// (`WorkspaceSplitRoot`). A fully AppKit-owned pane tree was tried first
/// (v0.50) and reverted: five attempts could not reproduce SwiftUI's
/// compositor-coordinated zoom smoothness, and the workspace boundary is
/// where AppKit ownership actually pays.
///
/// The reconciler pattern survives at this level: `renderNow()` reads the
/// workspace list + active ids inside `withObservationTracking`, syncs
/// containers, and re-arms. `syncFocus` stays the keyboard authority for
/// workspace SWITCHES (nothing re-mounts on a switch anymore, so the old
/// mount-time grab can't fire); within a workspace the restored SwiftUI tree
/// keeps its original mount-grab + click-gesture focus paths.

/// Shared base for the host's containers: top-left origin and re-layout on
/// any own-frame change.
