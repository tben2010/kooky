// one response line back, then close. `kind: "cli"` is the discriminator
// that routes a line into the request/response branch instead of the hook
// event parser — hook payloads either carry a different `kind` or none at
// all, and never this one.
//
// These types live in KookyHookKit so the `kooky-cli` binary and the app
// compile the SAME request/response structs — the wire shape can't drift
// between the two ends the way a comment-synced dict contract could.
